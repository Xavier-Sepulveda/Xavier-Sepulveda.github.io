## Self-Assesment

### Overview:
While working toward completing my Computer Science degree at Southern New Hampshire University, I was able to experience and work with different aspects of computer sciences. From working in a team environment, learning about different computer languages, and how the different aspects of computer sciences relate to what we may see in the field. Throughout my schooling I worked on a number of assignments that I believe show some of my abilities and strengths. Some assignments will be included in this ePortfolio to showcase some of those abilities such as the Coding Collision assignment, Zoo Monitoring assignment, and the Animal Shelter Database assignment. The aspects learned from these assignments have helped to give me the skills needed to become a strong employee within the computer science industry. I will touch upon some specific courses, and how they helped to give me a better understanding of the following topics.

### Collaborating in a team environment:
I current work in IT, with a team of 6 of us. My day to day includes troubleshooting software issues, along with distributing and re-imaging laptops. It important to be able to collaborate in the field. I have learned a lot from the senior level employees where I work. I think it is important to be able to work in a team environment, and some of the courses I have taken have help me to be a beneficial member of my team. In CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project, we learned how to collaborate on a software project. We were tasked with contributing our own portions of code into a juke box program, and push those changes using git. In this course we were introduced to collaboration strategies, and how to utilize industry-standard tools and techniques. 

### Communicating to Stakeholders:
I learned about communicating to stakeholders when taking CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle. In this course we learned how to identify and apply appropriate software development lifecycle models and methodologies. Stakeholders are the people who are affected by the outcome of a software development project, so as a developer knowing the requirement to a project relate heavily to the stakeholders. They want to know that the needs of the company/end user are fulfilled. For example, the projects included in this ePortfolio have expected outcomes/requirements. Stakeholders are looking to see that those outcomes/requirements are what is expected, to have a completed project.

### Data Structures and Algorithms:
I learned about multiple aspects related to data structures and algorithms from a number of courses I’ve taken. To name a few, IT-145 Foundation in Application Development, CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms, and CS-320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. You will see some direct examples of things learned when looking at the included artifacts, such as how data structures differ among different computer languages.  In CS-320 Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance we learned how to structure test cases, so they pass the proper information and be sure the proper outcome is reached. 

### Software Engineering and Databases:
There were also a number of course I’ve taken to gain skills and understanding in software engineering and databases. You will be able to see me showcase my ability to create a RESTful API. The RESTful API will use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to update data stored in a database. Some other examples come from courses like CS-405 Secure Coding, where we learned techniques and strategies to mitigate vulnerabilities within software. In CS-410 Reverse Software Engineering, I learned how to reverse engineer code. this is a good skill because it helps if a program need to be recreated to run on a different operating system, or if the legacy code needs to be updated to today’s standards.

### Security:
Many courses touched upon the importance of security. You can see some aspects put into place such as the authentication function utilized in the Zoo Monitoring Application, or the technique used to connect to my database for the Animal Shelter Database. Another Course that touched upon the aspect of security was CS-405 Secure Coding. I learned how to put a security policy together, which included a Defense in Depth approach, principles to follow, and coding standards.
